# RNA Interference (RNAi) - DNA to RNA Transcription

This project is part of a bioengineering initiative to develop targeted therapies using RNA interference (RNAi). The goal is to transcribe a given DNA sequence into its RNA complement, which is a crucial step in the RNAi process.

## Project Overview

The application takes a DNA sequence as input and generates the corresponding RNA sequence by replacing each nucleotide with its complement:
- **G** -> **C**
- **C** -> **G**
- **T** -> **A**
- **A** -> **U**

This project follows Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles and adheres to SOLID design principles.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Maven (for dependency management and builds)
- JUnit 5 (for unit testing)
- Hamcrest (for expressive assertions in tests)
